<td class=ContentSection valign=top><div class=CGeneric id=MainTopic><div class=CTopic><h1 class=CTitle><a name="Runtime_Environments"></a>Runtime Environments</h1><div class=CBody><p class=CParagraph>You have several different options for deploying a Junction-based web application, depending on where you want your web application code and database to run...</p><ul class=CBulletList><li>Run your Junction application in a web application server.</li><li>Run your Junction application in a web browser client.</li><li>Run your Junction application in both places.</li></ul><h4 class=CHeading>Run Your Junction Application In A Web Application Server</h4><p class=CParagraph>This type of deployment is similar to how you use other server-side web application frameworks, such as Ruby on Rails, Django, or Java Servlets/JSP/Hibernate.</p><p class=CParagraph>Here is a simplified picture that shows how a web application server is responsible for dynamically generating HTTP responses from requests from web clients.&nbsp;  The web application server executes the web application&rsquo;s Controller, Model and View code on the server-side.&nbsp; The Model code provides object-relational access to data from a relational database management server (RDBMS).</p><blockquote><pre class=CCode>client-side:                         server-side:<br>+-------------+                      +----------------+<br>| web browser |                      | web app server |<br>|             |                      |                | +-----------+<br>| &lt;a href&gt;    | ==&gt; HTTP request ==&gt; | Controller     | |           |<br>|             |                      |        Model &lt;=====&gt; RDBMS   |<br>|             | &lt;== HTTP response == | View           | |           |<br>+-------------+                      +----------------+ +-----------+</pre></blockquote><p class=CParagraph>Junction&rsquo;s web-application server is implemented using the open-source Rhino JavaScript scripting engine.</p><p class=CParagraph>In the Junction world, the Model and Controller application logic are coded in JavaScript.&nbsp;  View templates are coded using JavaScript Template (JST) markup tags (or by using EcmaScript Template (EST) markup tags, if you prefer).</p><p class=CParagraph>The request and response between the client and server may be for a full dynamically generated HTML result page, such as when a user clicks on a simple HTML link (&lt;a href=&rdquo;...&rdquo;&gt;).&nbsp; Or, the request/response may be for an Ajax-driven partial page fragment or for an Ajax-driven XML/JSON data result.</p><p class=CParagraph>One issue with running Junction on the server-side is that users need to be always fully connected to use the web application.&nbsp;  This precludes mobile clients or clients who have a slow, intermittent or unavailable network connection (think of iPhone).&nbsp;  The next deployment scenario discussed provides a partial solution, allowing users to use their web application even when offline.</p><h4 class=CHeading>Run Your Junction Application In A Web Browser Client</h4><p class=CParagraph>Alternatively, you can have your Junction-based application running entirely in the web browser client.</p><blockquote><pre class=CCode>client-side:                                      server-side:<br>+---------------------------------------------+   +----------------+<br>| web browser                                 |   | web app server |<br>|                                             |   +----------------+<br>| &lt;a href&gt;    +~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~+<br>|             '  +---------------+ +--------+ |<br>|  request ====&gt; | Controller    | |        | |<br>|             '  |        Model &lt;===&gt; RDBMS | |<br>|  response &lt;=== | View          | |        | |<br>|             '  +---------------+ +--------+ |<br>|             '   junctionClient              |<br>+-------------+-------------------------------+</pre></blockquote><p class=CParagraph>In this deployment scenario, the same Model-View-Controller code as from the previous server-side case is instead deployed into a web page and downloaded into the web browser.&nbsp; So, all the Model-View-Controller application code executes completely in the web browser on each request (it&rsquo;s all just JavaScript, after all).&nbsp; We note again that it&rsquo;s the <u>same</u> application code in both server-side and client-side runtime scenarios.&nbsp;  For example, your View template code still gets processed and rendered the same way, whether running on the server or on the client.</p><p class=CParagraph>Junction API&rsquo;s and conventions are designed so that a single application codebase should be able to run either on the server-side or on the client-side without any conditional environment checking logic in your application code.&nbsp;  You&rsquo;ll need to follow simple rules, though, such as not accessing &lsquo;document.body&rsquo; or calling &lsquo;alert(&ldquo;Hi&rdquo;)&rsquo; in your Models, Views or Controllers, because such API&rsquo;s are not available when executing in a server-side environment.</p><p class=CParagraph>In the web browser, a junctionClient runtime component mediates between processing requests from the user and displaying responses back in the web browser page.&nbsp;  The junctionClient runtime component is itself written in JavaScript.</p><p class=CParagraph>In this environment, HTML links and controls that the user clicks on in the page require an onclick/onsubmit event handler that invokes the junctionClient runtime...</p><blockquote><pre class=CCode>&lt;a href=&quot;...&quot;<br>   onclick=&quot;return TrimPath.junctionClient.get(...request info...)&quot;&gt;<br>   Show All Products<br>&lt;/a&gt;<br><br>&lt;form action=&quot;...&quot;<br>      onsubmit=&quot;return TrimPath.junctionClient.postForm(...)&quot;&gt;<br>  ...<br>&lt;/form&gt;</pre></blockquote><p class=CParagraph>Because the junctionClient runtime is invoked as part of the event handler, it will process the request locally, using the client-side MVC application code and local RDBMS.&nbsp;  It is as if a mini-web-application-server was running right in your browser.&nbsp;  This often provides a marked improvement in UI responsiveness since there is no communication with any remote server and thus avoids any hiccups or failures due to slow, intermittent or unavailable network connectivity.&nbsp;  (Think of Safari on the iPhone on a weak network connection.)&nbsp;  Junction can also additionally utilize the LocalServer offline capabilities of Google Gears, if available, allowing the application to be loaded, started and run without any network connection.</p><p class=CParagraph>The RDBMS in this deployment scenario is a client-side, browser-local RDBMS.&nbsp;  Junction will automatically use Google Gears RDBMS facilities, if installed and available.&nbsp;  Or, Junction will default to using a simple memory-only, non-persistent RDBMS that should be treated like a local data cache.</p><p class=CParagraph>The server-side in this deployment scenario may be very simple -- conceptually just a server that publishes the static resources, MVC code, and libraries that comprise the application.&nbsp;  The RDBMS, after all, is in the client.&nbsp;  The Junction web application server does, however, also provide for useful application code updating and schema migration services in this client-heavy deployment scenario.&nbsp; This scenario, too, provides a good story for server-side scalability, because the server is doing very little work.</p><p class=CParagraph>However, the preeminent issue with this deployment scenario is that <u>the user&rsquo;s data is not shared</u>.&nbsp;  Even with Google Gears RDBMS installed in the user&rsquo;s web browser to allow for persistent data, any data created by a user is kept only on their own computer.&nbsp; Some folks might see this as a feature beneficial to their privacy.&nbsp; Indeed, an interesting set of personal productivity or other applications might be amenable to this client-side, unshared-data deployment scenario (e.g., a personal financial asset tracker; a personal todo-list manager).</p><p class=CParagraph>Many other applications or business use cases, though, require users to share data (e.g., team productivity applications).&nbsp;  While the client-side, unshared-data scenario might be interesting as a first step in a menu of application service-level plans (e.g., Personal Edition, $5/month), especially since it consumes so few server resources, eventually providing for team shared data is required (e.g., Basic Team Edition, $20/month/user).</p><p class=CParagraph>The next deployment scenario provides a solution to allowing for offline clients, responsive UI&rsquo;s and for shared team data...</p><h4 class=CHeading>Run Your Junction Application In Both Client-Side And-Server Side</h4><blockquote><pre class=CCode>client-side:                            server-side:<br>+-----------------------------------+   +------------+<br>| web browser                       |   | web app    |<br>|                                   |   | server     |<br>|                      B.           |   |            | +---------+<br>|                      request =======&gt;
