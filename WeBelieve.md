## We believe in pragmatic elegance. ##

The community here is about technology.  About code.  So let's make beautiful, useful technology and code.

## We believe in web-based lightness and orthogonality. ##

TrimPath should not be one giant bolus of monolithic library.  TrimPath components should be individually consumable by developers.  We're a'la carte, loosely joined.  Avoid tangles that require folks to drag in the whole shebang.

Similarly, if users want to use their own favorite libraries (say, like dojo, jquery, prototype, or some great calender control or nice CSS), they should.  Don't do anything to prevent it.  Be orthogonol, be web-standard, and don't force our users into a walled garden.

## We believe in community. ##

It's about sharing, in giving back.  It's about friends, about having fun.  Hence TrimPath is open source.
