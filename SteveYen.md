I'm a founder of TrimPath and [Metaha](http://www.metaha.com).  Further back, I also was a co-founder of [Escalate](http://www.escalate.com) and KIVA Software.

I've been playing lately with Brendan and Waldemar's little language, JavaScript, trying to see for myself if all this rich web application hoo-dad (Ajax) is really going to fly.  First, after un-learning everything I thought I knew about the JavaScript, I think I'm starting to understand.

Also, I've started exploring [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.com).

I hear I must keep my New Year's resolutions secret if they are to come true.
