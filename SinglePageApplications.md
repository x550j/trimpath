# Single Page Application #

A '''SPA''' is a web application that fits on a single page, and which might be optionally enhanced by connectivity with a server.

Some recent examples of SPA include the "Wiki On A Stick" or "Wiki On A Flash Drive" apps:
  * [TiddlyWiki](http://www.tiddlywiki.com)
  * [GTDTiddlyWiki](http://shared.snapgrid.com/gtd_tiddlywiki.html), an adaptation of an older version of TiddlyWiki
  * [HailiWiki](http://www.kevembuangga.com/hwk)
The key property of these Wiki On A Stick web applications is that you can do a "File->Save Page" in your browser and get your own personal wiki.  All the wiki pages and data then lives on your own local storage and is private to you.
  * TiwyWiki (take it with you wiki)

Although these personal wiki's are interesting and have a chance at replacing your todo.txt file, I think they are only a hint at the applications that are possible in the SPA paradigm.

TrimJunction aims for this future by adding Model-View-Controller and SQL programming concepts to the SPA party, with all the amenities that we've come to expect from open-source and view-source hospitality.
