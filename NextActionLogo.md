# Next Action Logo #

```
Hello,

I just begun to use nextAction. Seems to be the thing I was looking for
(thinking I had to code it myself) more over really attracted by this
concept of SPADE. The first thing I had to face is to put a beautifull
icon. It's a very simple one (a pitty I'm no artist). I send it to you
as a kind of thanks.

Cheers
Alex.
