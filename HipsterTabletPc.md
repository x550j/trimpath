# Hipster Tablet PC #

'''A Hipster Tablet PC''' is just like the [Hipster PDA](http://www.google.com/search?q=Hipster+PDA), except bigger and cheaper.

Especially great for people who can't afford 3x5 index cards!

Instructions:
  * Get several sheets of 8x11 paper.
  * Staple it in a corner several times so everything's bound pretty sturdy.
  * Tri-fold it as though you were putting it into a standard letter envelope.
  * But, put it into your back pocket instead.
  * Done

Features:
  * Easily found materials: any bunch of 8x11's and stapler can become a factory for the Hipster Tablet PC.
