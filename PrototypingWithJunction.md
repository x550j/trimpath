# Prototyping With Junction #

{ [Junction home](http://code.google.com/p/trimpath/wiki/TrimJunction) | [documentation](http://trimpath.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/junction_docs/index.html) }

[Prototyping applications with Ajax](http://www.ajaxian.com/archives/2005/07/prototyping_des.html) has been considered by the blogosphere.  How about quickly prototyping applications using the [Junction](http://code.google.com/p/trimpath/wiki/TrimJunction) framework instead?  About this wiki page is to record techniques and ideas for fast prototyping of Junction-based applications.

Since Junction supports [SPADE](http://code.google.com/p/trimpath/wiki/SinglePageApplicationAndDevelopmentEnvironment) in-browser development tools, your development productivity should be pretty high.

When demoing to and working with your onsite '''customers or your''' domain experts, you can use the [SPADE](http://code.google.com/p/trimpath/wiki/SinglePageApplicationAndDevelopmentEnvironment) tools to affect improvements immediately.  Take their suggestions and '''feedback and make it happen''' right there, using any web browser.  Jaws might drop and heads may bow.

''Well, more seriously, .css files, .jst templates, controller code, model code, and schema are all live editable, in that order of higher-to-lower safety.''

If you're just trying to get everybody on the same page ("This is what it will kind of look like") then Junction should be a good prototyping fit.  Political warnings and dangers: non-developers don't understand that a prototype isn't the real thing.  Will a prototype scale, be secure, etc etc.  They may confuse a good prototype with being done, wondering "the prototype works nice, so why do you need N more months to make it real?"
