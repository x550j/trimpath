# Junction Demo #

The most complete application built on Junction is called [Next Action](http://code.google.com/p/trimpath/wiki/NextAction), a todo-list tracking tool in the [Getting Things Done](http://code.google.com/p/trimpath/wiki/GettingThingsDone) style.

The demo's data model is for action, context, and project tracking.  It relies on Google Gears for client-side RDBMS persistence.  If you don't have Gears installed, the Junction framework automatically degrades and seamlessly switches to use a non-persistent, in-memory RDBMS (see TrimQuery), which is useful behavior for demos, test-drives, and using Next Action from a friend's computer.
