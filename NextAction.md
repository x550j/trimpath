# Next Action, Personal Edition #

Next Action is a [Getting Things Done](http://code.google.com/p/trimpath/wiki/GettingThingsDone) todo-list tracking tool. It's a personal database for your action items and todo lists that you use through your web browser.

## Features Include: ##
  * Fast and snappy.
  * Easy to use.
  * Open source.
  * Works even if your network connection is offline, slow, or has hiccups.

## Getting started: ##

To run the fully enabled version of Next Action, Personal Edition, please first install the [Google Gears](http://gears.google.com) browser extension.  If you haven't installed Google Gears, you'll still be able to demo or test-drive Next Action, Personal Edition, but only in demo mode.  In demo mode, you won't be able to save any data that you've created.

After you have Gears installed, or just want to try it out, please visit the following link...

  * Start [Next Action, Personal Edition](http://trimpath.com/demos/static_nextaction.html)

In Next Action, Personal Edition, any data you create is stored locally on your computer. That is, your records are not saved on a distant server, but are instead kept in a fast Google Gears database on your own computer.

Be sure to setup a bookmark to the above link so you can get back to Next Action and your todo lists conveniently.

## Software required: ##
Supported web browsers : Firefox 2.0+, IE 7+.

Google Gears : the [Google Gears](http://gears.google.com) browser extension is required to fully enable Next Action.

## How To I Upgrade? ##
The latest version of Next Action, based on a revamped architecture around Google Gears, is unfortunately, incompatible with previous 'File->Save Page As' versions of Next Action.

Because of the new architecture, future upgrades of Next Action, however, will feature automated migration.
