# JavaScript #

JavaScript - the language that graduates from "toy" to "hey, that's surprisingly nice" in 2005.

Ok, so throughout the site, I probably should be using "ECMAScript" instead of "JavaScript".  For those detail oriented folks, just put on your mental word translators.

JavaScript also appears in...
  * in lots of browsers (often [inelegantly](http://code.google.com/p/trimpath/wiki/InelegantJavaScript))
  * in Flash - as their ActionScript scripting language
  * in Adobe products
  * in SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)
